# NLP Interaction Processor
This interaction processor uses **natural language processing** (NLP) to extract rules from error messages returned by the server. The idea behind this component is to analyse the messages returned in response to incorrect API requests (```400 status code```) to extract useful information and convert this data into testable rules.   

First, it is checked whether the interaction is processable. Then it is checked whether the processor is active, whether the interaction has been executed and whether the response has a ```400 status code```.   
The body of the response is then analysed and if a string with the name “message” is found, it is sent to the NLP module (```RuleExtractorProxy```) to extract any rules implicit in the server message.   
The response headers are also analysed. If the latter does not contain a content-type header, the processor still attempts to extract rules based on the entire content of the response.   
The extracted rules are stored in a set (```rulesFromServerMessage```).   
This interaction processor makes it possible to dynamically learn new validation rules based on the errors generated by the server and can be used to improve automatic tests by adapting them to the actual responses of the tested system.
