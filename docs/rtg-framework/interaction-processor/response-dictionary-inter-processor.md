# Response Dictionary Interaction Processor
This interaction processor stores the parameters of API responses in a global dictionary and a local dictionary. The aim is to collect and store the parameter values in the body of the tested API responses in order to be able to reuse them in future tests. Again, it is checked whether the interaction is processable, i.e. whether it was successfully executed and whether the response has a positive status code, i.e. 200 or 201. It is also checked whether the response body isnâ€™t empty. If all conditions are met, then the response body is analysed and the LeafParameters are extracted, null values are excluded, and for each valid parameter an entry is created and added to the global dictionary. If there is also a local dictionary, the entry is also added there.
