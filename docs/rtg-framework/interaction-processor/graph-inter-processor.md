# Graph Interaction Processor
This is an implementation of the abstract class InteractionProcessor that updates a dependency graph between API operations based on the responses received in tests.  First of all, it is checked whether the interaction can be processed. In fact, only interactions that have been successfully executed are processed. After that, the interaction is processed. The operation is marked as tested in the dependency graph (OperationDependencyGraph). The response body is analysed to identify parameters that may satisfy dependencies of other operations, and the graph is updated, marking detected dependencies as "satisfied".
