# Nominal Fuzzer
This fuzzer is designed to generate nominal test sequences for interaction with a REST API. The main purpose of this class is to create test sequences that simulate different input scenarios to test the behavior of an operation.  The ```generateTestSequence()``` method generates a single test sequence. First, the original operation is cloned into an “editableOperation”. Let us look in detail at the various methods used to value the parameters:
- **```setValue(Parameter parameter)```**: sets the value of a parameter. If the parameter is of type ```LeafParameter``` (a parameter that has no children), it sets the value using the value provider. If the parameter is an array of ```LeafParameters```, set the value for each element of the array. 
- **```populateArrays()```**: fills the arrays in the operation with copies of the reference elements. Each array has a minimum and maximum number of elements that may be added. If an array is not mandatory, there is a probability of removing it completely. 
- **```setValuesToLeaves()```**: assigns a value to parameters of type ```LeafParameter```. If the parameter is not mandatory, it has a 10% chance of not receiving a value. In addition, it handles leaf parameters that belong to an array differently.
