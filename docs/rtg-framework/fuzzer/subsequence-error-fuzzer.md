# Subsequence Error Fuzzer
This class is designed to generate test sequences that simulate errors in sub-sequences of an existing test sequence. Unlike other fuzzers, this class takes an existing test sequence, chooses a sub-sequence and corrupts it, applying mutations to the operation parameters it contains.  

The original test sequence is divided into sub-sequences of increasing size. It starts at a length of 1, up to the length of the original sequence. For each sub-sequence, a copy is created, and mutations are applied. Each mutation is applied to the last element of the sub-sequence (i.e. last interaction). For each ```LeafParameter``` in the operation, a mutator is chosen that can be applied to the parameter. Once the mutation has been applied, the test sequence is executed with ```TestRunner```, which simulates the execution of the operation with the mutation applied. The ```ErrorStatusCodeOracle``` is used to check whether the expected error occurs during the execution of the sequence, i.e. whether the test sequence produces the expected error status code for a given mutation type.
