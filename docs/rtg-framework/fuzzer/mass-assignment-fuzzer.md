# Mass Assignment Fuzzer
This fuzzer deals with generating sequences to check the vulnerability of mass assignments.  This class accepts an object of type CrudGroup that contains a set of CRUD operations on an object. These operations are divided into distinct sets. The “producer”, “consumer” and “read-only” parameters are identified (i.e. they are returned by read operations but are never modified). After that, test sequences are generated to inject the parameters into CRUD operations. These sequences test how a REST API handles mass assignment and may include attempts to modify parameters that should not be modifiable. A significant part of the class is devoted to generating test sequences for injecting parameters into creation operations. These sequences are executed on various read-only parameters and try to see if the application can be affected by modifying parameters that should not be modifiable.  Within this fuzzer, you can also find the ```generateUpdateInjectionSequence``` method, which generates test sequences that test for vulnerabilities in the handling of update parameters by combining create, read and update operations in a sequence. In this case, for each read-only parameter, a sequence is created whereby a resource is created, its parameters are read, and finally an update operation is performed that attempts to inject an unscheduled parameter into the update process.
