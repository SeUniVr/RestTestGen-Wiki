# Status Code Oracle
This is an oracle that evaluates the outcome of a ```TestSequence```, based on the HTTP status codes of the answers.  First, it is checked whether the ```TestSequence``` was executed and if, at least one ```TestInteraction``` was not executed, everything is terminated with an error. After that, the status codes of the answers are analysed. If all interactions have a status code of class ```2XX```, then the test passes. Otherwise, if at least one interaction has a ```5XX``` error code, the test is considered to have failed. If neither of these two conditions occur and at least one interaction has an error code of class ```4XX``` (i.e. client error), then the test is indeterminate.
