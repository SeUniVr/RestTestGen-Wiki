# Mass Assignment Oracle
This oracle checks whether a test sequence has exposed a **Mass Assignment vulnerability**. This vulnerability occurs when an attacker is able to modify unintended fields of an object sent to a REST API.   

First, the sequence is tested. Next, it looks to see if an "injected" value appears in a subsequent request to the API. If this is true, it means that an unexpected parameter was accepted and saved by the server. It then determines whether the vulnerability is present and classifies the result as ```FAIL``` if the vulnerability was successfully exploited twice; as ```UNKNOWN``` if the vulnerability was only exploited once; as ```PASS ```if the exploit attempt was unsuccessful. The main method of the class is ```assertTestSequence()``` which may be regarded as the heart of the oracle, where the test sequence is analyzed. Each Test Interaction is scanned for an injected parameter. The injected value is compared to the value returned by the next read operation and then counted how many times the injected value is reflected in the response.
