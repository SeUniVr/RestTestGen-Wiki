# Constraint Violation Parameter Mutator
Is a mutator that alters parameter values so as to violate their constraints.  First, it is checked whether a parameter is mutable (i.e. whether it is an enum with predefined values, a string with minimum or maximum length constraints, a number with upper or lower bounds). If the parameter is mutable, then it is modified to violate its constraints. Thus, if the parameter is an enum, a random value is set that does not belong to the list of values; if the parameter is a string, the length constraint is violated; if the parameter is a number, finally, the minimum or maximum value constraint is violated. The aim is to generate **invalid input** to test the behaviour of the system in the event of errors.
