# RestAssured Writer
Allows the created ```TestSequence``` to be converted into test cases using the RestAssured framework. The class consists of various methods for creating a suitable test class. First, the necessary imports are defined and the actual class is generated with its annotations. Then, for each ```TestInteraction``` in the sequence, the corresponding method within the test class is generated. This means that for each ```TestInteraction```, the method signature is created, the parameters are initialised, the request to be performed is defined and, finally, the assertions are also specified.
