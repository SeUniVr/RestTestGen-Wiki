# Global Dictionary Priority Parameter Value Provider
This multiple value selection strategy gives priority to the answer dictionary.  First, an attempt is made to obtain a value from the answer dictionary and, if there are values available, one of these is returned. If, on the other hand, the dictionary does not return any values, other strategies are then tried using the ```EnumParameterValueProvider```, ```ExamplesParameterValueProvider``` and ```DefaultParameterValueProvider```. At this point, if none of the previous strategies provided a value, the random generation with Random or Narrow Random strategy is performed.
