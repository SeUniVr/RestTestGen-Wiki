# Local Dictionary Priority Parameter Value Provider
This technique attempts to value a ```LeafParameter```, using different strategies, but still giving priority to the use of the local dictionary. Nevertheless, if the local dictionary does not have a valid value, it switches to other strategies.   
The function ```provideValueFor(LeafParameter leafParameter)``` attempts to obtain a value from the local dictionary, if the local dictionary is available, the ResponseDictionaryParameterValueProvider is used and if the dictionary has a usable value, that is taken.   
However, if the local dictionary has no available values, alternative sources such as Enum, Examples or Default values are tried. Finally, if none of the previous strategies provides a value, a random value is generated and, in this case, ```Random``` or ```NarrowRandom``` is chosen.
