# Enum and Example Priority Parameter Value Provider
This is a multiple selection strategy for choosing a value for the ```LeafParameter```. In this case, the two providers ```EnumParameterValueProvider``` and ```ExamplesParameterValueProvider``` are retrieved and the available values for each provider are counted. If at least one of the two has available values, a decision is made whether to choose one of them with a probability of 80%. In this case, a random choice is made between the EnumParameterValueProvider and the ExamplesParameterValueProvider.   
If there are no values available for the two Value Providers, i.e. there are neither Enum values nor Examples, or if the remaining 20% probability falls into, another strategy is used.   

A list of always available providers is retrieved: ```RandomParameterValueProvider``` and ```NarrowRandomParameterValueProvider```. A list of conditional Value Providers is then also created: ```DefaultParameterValueProvider```, ```ResponseDictionaryParameterValueProvider```, ```LastResponseDictionaryParameterValueProvider```. They are filtered and only those with at least one available value are retained.  

If a choice has not yet been made, then a Value Provider is randomly chosen from those remaining to value the parameter.
