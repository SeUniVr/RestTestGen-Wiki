# Introduction

Within this section of the documentation, you will find a description of the **strategies** that have **already been implemented** within RestTestGen. In fact, you can test your API using the strategies that have already been made available, instead of creating your own.
Within this chapter, therefore, you can find a detailed description of the ***Nominal and Error Strategy***, which first verifies the correct functioning of the API and then specifically creates erroneous requests in order to detect any faults; the ***Mass Assignment Strategy***, which aims to detect the vulnerability of mass assignments; and the ***NLP Strategy***, which makes use of natural language processing techniques to improve API testing.
