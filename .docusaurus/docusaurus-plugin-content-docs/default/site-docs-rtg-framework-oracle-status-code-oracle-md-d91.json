  "description": "This is an oracle that evaluates the outcome of a `TestSequence`, based on the HTTP status codes of the answers.  First, it is checked whether the `TestSequence` was executed and if, at least one `TestInteraction` was not executed, everything is terminated with an error. After that, the status codes of the answers are analysed. If all interactions have a status code of class `2XX`, then the test passes. Otherwise, if at least one interaction has a `5XX` error code, the test is considered to have failed. If neither of these two conditions occur and at least one interaction has an error code of class `4XX` (i.e. client error), then the test is indeterminate.",
