  "description": "This is a multiple selection strategy for choosing a value for the `LeafParameter`. In this case, the two providers `EnumParameterValueProvider` and `ExamplesParameterValueProvider` are retrieved and the available values for each provider are counted. If at least one of the two has available values, a decision is made whether to choose one of them with a probability of 80%. In this case, a random choice is made between the EnumParameterValueProvider and the ExamplesParameterValueProvider.",
