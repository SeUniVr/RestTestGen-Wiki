  "description": "Similar to the class described above, values from a dictionary are also used here. However, the values are taken from a global response dictionary, i.e. from data obtained from the answers of executed requests. By default, the class uses the global response dictionary which is available via `Environment.getInstance()`. The constructor sets the `SAMENORMALISEDNAME` mode, allowing values to be collected not only by the exact name of the parameter, but also by its normalised name.",
