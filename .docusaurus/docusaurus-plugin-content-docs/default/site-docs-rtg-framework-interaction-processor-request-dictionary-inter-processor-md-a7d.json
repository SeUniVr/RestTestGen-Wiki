  "description": "This interaction processor stores the parameters of test requests in a global and local dictionary. The objective is to construct and maintain a dictionary of the request parameters used in tests, so that they can be reused in future tests. First, it is checked whether the interaction is processable, i.e. whether it was successfully executed and whether the status code is 200 or 201. If this is satisfied, then the request parameters are processed. After that, the interaction is processed. The parameters are taken from the request and used in the interaction. Leaf parameters and those with an assigned value are filtered out. For each valid parameter, an entry is created and added to the global dictionary. It is also possible to set up a local dictionary.",
