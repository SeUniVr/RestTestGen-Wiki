API architecture, in general, is explained in terms of client and server: there is an application that sends a request (client) and an application that sends the response (server).","sidebar":"overviewSidebar"},"rtg":{"id":"rtg","title":"RestTestGen","description":"RTG is a framework that provides a collection of extensible components to implement automated black-box testing strategies of REST APIs. This facilitates the work of those who want to implement new automated testing strategies, whether researchers or practitioners. The assumption made a priori is that one cannot have direct access to the source code, but only to the OpenAPI specification, and that one can interact with the REST API directly via the HTTP protocol.","sidebar":"overviewSidebar"},"rtg-framework/components/core-extensibile-description":{"id":"rtg-framework/components/core-extensibile-description","title":"Architecture","description":"The architecture of RTG can be seen in the figure. It provides developers and researchers with two types of components. It is possible to find core components that work out-of-the box, and extensible components that can be re-implemented to give developers, or those who need them, the possibility of creating totally customised strategies.","sidebar":"frameworkSidebar"},"rtg-framework/components/execution-pipeline":{"id":"rtg-framework/components/execution-pipeline","title":"Execution Pipeline","description":"RTG Execution Pipeline","sidebar":"frameworkSidebar"},"rtg-framework/datatype/operation":{"id":"rtg-framework/datatype/operation","title":"Operation","description":"io.resttestgen.core.openapi;","sidebar":"frameworkSidebar"},"rtg-framework/datatype/parameters":{"id":"rtg-framework/datatype/parameters","title":"Parameters","description":"io.resttestgen.core.datatype.parameter;","sidebar":"frameworkSidebar"},"rtg-framework/datatype/test-sequence-interaction-runner":{"id":"rtg-framework/datatype/test-sequence-interaction-runner","title":"Test Interaction, Test Sequence, Test Runner, Test Result","description":"io.resttestgen.core.testing;","sidebar":"frameworkSidebar"},"rtg-framework/fuzzer/fuzzer":{"id":"rtg-framework/fuzzer/fuzzer","title":"Fuzzer","description":"io.resttestgen.implementation.fuzzer;","sidebar":"frameworkSidebar"},"rtg-framework/interaction-processor/interaction-processor":{"id":"rtg-framework/interaction-processor/interaction-processor","title":"Interaction Processor","description":"io.resttestgen.implementation.interactionprocessor;","sidebar":"frameworkSidebar"},"rtg-framework/mutator/mutator":{"id":"rtg-framework/mutator/mutator","title":"Mutator","description":"io.resttestgen.implementation.mutator;","sidebar":"frameworkSidebar"},"rtg-framework/odg/odg":{"id":"rtg-framework/odg/odg","title":"Operation Dependency Graph","description":"io.resttestgen.core.operationdependencygraph;","sidebar":"frameworkSidebar"},"rtg-framework/operation-sorter/operation-sorter":{"id":"rtg-framework/operation-sorter/operation-sorter","title":"Operation Sorter","description":"io.resttestgen.implementation.operationssorter;","sidebar":"frameworkSidebar"},"rtg-framework/oracle/oracle":{"id":"rtg-framework/oracle/oracle","title":"Oracle","description":"io.resttestgen.implementation.oracle;","sidebar":"frameworkSidebar"},"rtg-framework/parser/parser":{"id":"rtg-framework/parser/parser","title":"OpenApi Parser","description":"io.resttestgen.core.openapi;","sidebar":"frameworkSidebar"},"rtg-framework/pvp/pvp":{"id":"rtg-framework/pvp/pvp","title":"Parameter Value Provider","description":"io.resttestgen.implementation.parametervalueprovider;","sidebar":"frameworkSidebar"},"rtg-framework/strategy/strategy":{"id":"rtg-framework/strategy/strategy","title":"Strategy","description":"io.resttestgen.implementation.strategy;","sidebar":"frameworkSidebar"},"rtg-framework/writer/writer":{"id":"rtg-framework/writer/writer","title":"Writer","description":"io.resttestgen.implementation.writer;","sidebar":"frameworkSidebar"},"rtg-tool/strategy/introduction":{"id":"rtg-tool/strategy/introduction","title":"Introduction","description":"Within this section of the documentation, you will find a description of the strategies that have already been implemented within RestTestGen.

This vulnerability originates from a misconfiguration of any REST API framework that can provide an automatic binding between input data fields (controlled by a potential attacker) and the internal data representation (e.g. database columns). Successful exploitation of such a vulnerability may allow malicious attackers to manipulate private data. However, they would have to guess the names of the internal data structures (e.g. database tables and columns) used by the REST API.","sidebar":"strategiesSidebar"},"rtg-tool/strategy/nlp-strategy":{"id":"rtg-tool/strategy/nlp-strategy","title":"NLP Strategy","description":"The idea of this strategy is to apply natural language processing techniques to improve the testing of REST APIs. Given an OpenAPI specification, some additional rules are extracted based on the human-readable part of the specification. Consider, for example, a particular specification that describes the parameters of a particular request. We may, for example, have the parameter `language` to which is associated a `description` in which the accepted values are made explicit. Similarly, we may have a `count` parameter to which, again, is associated a `description` field in which it is specified that the maximum value is `50`. In these two cases, a normal automated testing tool could miss these characteristics and thus create unsuitable or failing test cases.","sidebar":"strategiesSidebar"},"rtg-tool/strategy/nominal-error-strategy":{"id":"rtg-tool/strategy/nominal-error-strategy","title":"Nominal and Error Strategy","description":"The objective of this strategy is to successfully test all the operations in the REST API that are to be investigated. To do this, an ordering based on the Operation Dependency Graph (ODG) is defined. For all other responsibilities (generation of input values, oracles and writers), this strategy is based on basic components available in the framework.","sidebar":"strategiesSidebar"},"rtg-tool/strategy/strategy":{"id":"rtg-tool/strategy/strategy","title":"Strategy","description":"To execute RestTestGen, the `main()` method inside the App class within the package `io.resttestgen.boot.cli` is executed. Within the project, there is also a configuration file `rtg-config.yml` in which anyone wishing to use the tool must specify the strategy to be used and the API to be tested."}}}}
