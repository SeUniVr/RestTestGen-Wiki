{"categoryGeneratedIndex":{"title":"Mutator","description":"A mutator is a software component that modifies in a controlled manner certain aspects of an entity, such as data, parameters or operations, with the aim of generating variations useful for testing, optimisation or analysis of the robustness of a system. Two types of mutator can be found within RTG: the parameter mutator (e.g. modifies the values of input parameters, introducing random or targeted variations) and the operation mutator (e.g. changes the behaviour of operations, e.g. by replacing parameters).","slug":"/category/mutator","permalink":"/docs/category/mutator","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar","navigation":{"previous":{"title":"Response Dictionary Interaction Processor","permalink":"/docs/rtg-framework/interaction-processor/response-dictionary-inter-processor"},"next":{"title":"Operation Mutator","permalink":"/docs/category/operation-mutator"}}}}
